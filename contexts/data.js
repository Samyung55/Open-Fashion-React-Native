And honestly they are probably the best pieces to mix and match. I truly think the key to completing a look is with a great bag and I found so many this year that I wanted to share a round-up of my most worn handbags.",

The mini Fendi bucket bag with the sheer fabric is so fun and such a statement bag. Also this DeMellier off white bag is so cute to carry to a dinner with you or going out, it’s small but not too small to fit your phone and keys still.",
